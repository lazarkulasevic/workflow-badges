# Public Workflow Badges

## Purpose

Most people setup notification at the end of a pipeline, whether it is a Slack message or a simple email. Some of those people commit to a repo within an organization, which makes it private, resulting a workflow status badge in a broken image. Well, I love these badges which is why I created intentionally failing and succeeding pipelines to reuse their badges as I want and where I want.

You are free to use them too! :smiley:
